# CoinDonation

GOAL

To create a general awareness among the people we have taken a small initiative where we have created a platform where one can donate crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum from crypto platform like coinswitch kuber or coinbase or binance moreover as there are over two billion people with access to the Internet who don't have rights to use to traditional exchange systems but are willing to donate through mines; A NGO site which is enabled with the crypto wallet as well as the INR wallet which goes to NGO fund, where donor is able to donate coins as well as Indian rupee.

#Working

We have provided the donor with three options for donations, to make their experience better; Donor can donate incentive either in the form of INR which is linked with RazorPay payment gateway where he/she can donote in INR, Second option is that they can donate crypto currency like BTC by scanning the QR code address which is linked with #CoinBase Wllet, Third option is that they can donate #POLYGON MATIC crypto which has comparitively less gas fees and is MADE IN INDIA. If donor has his own mine they can simply copy the wallet address from the site  and send from his crypto mine(Mining Platforms like CudoMiner, NiceHash, etc).

#Vision 


Every transaction, expenditure, and remittance can be easily tracked, making it difficult for a middlemen. Also, the money can be transferred directly into the recipient’s crypto wallets to avoid tampering.
Someone once said that charity is about poor people in rich countries sending money to rich people in poor countries. Well, with Altcoins; this will no longer be the case, the money will be for the kids, the mothers, and the people for whom it was intended.
By creating portal where rich businessmen can pool their incentive for upliftment of the needy, we are able to help both the charity and the donor. For saving taxes rich coms invest in these altcoins or NFT(Ethereum) as an investment and to tackle inflation.
•	Now these altcoins can be used a currency apart from the country’s currency and is universally accepted also like a digital asset. From another point of view due to inflation if the donor donates the national currency example rupee its value decreases by time but by donating altcoins like bitcoin, with its trend it increases significantly by time.

#FUTURE GOAL


Our Future goal is to connect all the local NGO's and Charities to our portal.
